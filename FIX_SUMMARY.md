# Fix Summary: Viflcraft Auth Plugin Error

## Problem
The plugin was throwing this error:
```
Could not set generator for world 'limbo': Plugin 'librelogin' does not exist
```

Additionally, the server would:
- Start normally and accept console commands
- Appear OFFLINE when pinged from Minecraft
- Reject connection attempts from Minecraft clients

## Root Cause
The plugin was forked from LibreLogin and renamed to ViflcraftAuth. However, there was a hardcoded reference to the old plugin name "librelogin" in the world generator configuration.

**Location of Bug:**
- File: `/app/Plugin/src/main/java/win/sectorfive/viflcraftauth/paper/PaperPlatformHandle.java`
- Line: 70
- Old code: `creator.generator("librelogin:void");`

When the plugin tried to create a limbo world, it specified "librelogin:void" as the generator, but Minecraft couldn't find a plugin named "librelogin" (because it's now "ViflcraftAuth").

## Solution
Changed the world generator reference from the old plugin name to the new one:

**Fixed code:**
```java
creator.generator("ViflcraftAuth:void");
```

## Files Modified
1. `/app/Plugin/src/main/java/win/sectorfive/viflcraftauth/paper/PaperPlatformHandle.java` - Line 70

## Build Information
- The plugin has been successfully rebuilt with Java 21
- Compiled plugin location: `/app/Plugin/build/libs/ViflcraftAuth.jar`
- Build status: âœ… SUCCESS

## Installation Instructions
1. Stop your Minecraft server
2. Remove the old plugin jar from your `plugins/` folder
3. Copy the new jar: `/app/Plugin/build/libs/ViflcraftAuth.jar` to your server's `plugins/` folder
4. Start your Minecraft server
5. The error should no longer appear, and the server should be accessible from Minecraft clients

## Testing Recommendations
After installing the fixed plugin:
1. Check server logs for the error message - it should be gone
2. Try pinging the server from Minecraft server list - it should appear online
3. Try connecting from a Minecraft client - connection should work
4. Test authentication features to ensure everything works properly

## Technical Notes
- The limbo world is used by the authentication plugin to hold players before they log in
- The void world generator creates an empty world (no terrain) for the limbo area
- This fix ensures the generator is properly registered with the correct plugin name
